# Python-for-Offensive-PenTest
This is the code repository for [Python for Offensive PenTest](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/aws-bootcamp), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
Python is an easy-to-learn and cross-platform programming language that has unlimited third-party libraries. Plenty of open source hacking tools are written in Python, which can be easily integrated within your script.

This book is packed with step-by-step instructions and working examples to make you a skilled penetration tester. It is divided into clear bite-sized chunks, so you can learn at your own pace and focus on the areas of most interest to you. This book will teach you how to code a reverse shell and build an anonymous shell. You will also learn how to hack passwords and perform a privilege escalation on Windows with practical examples. You will set up your own virtual hacking environment in VirtualBox, which will help you run multiple operating systems for your testing environment.

By the end of this book, you will have learned how to code your own scripts and mastered ethical hacking from scratch.

## Instructions and Navigation
All the codes are arranged chapter wise,

'''
def transfer(s,path):
        if os.path.exists(path):
            f = open(path, 'rb')
            packet = f.read(1024)
            while packet != '':
                s.send(packet) 
                packet = f.read(1024)
            s.send('DONE')
            f.close()
